## RPG Character Management Tool (DSA 4)

Fed up with spreadsheets and unmanageable walls of numbers, hidden dependencies and formulas nobody can keep track of anymore?

I would like to make role play games based on the DSA 4 system fun and easy again by creating a web app that is able to generate, calculate, change, import und export your character data while showing just the information and data you need in different phases and situations of the game.

Comments and suggestions are welcome!
